# README

This ecommerce store was built during my time at Actualize coding bootcamp.
In building it I learned a lot of back end fundementals including 
- CRUD operations
- RESTful routes
- Database Migrations
- Active Record
- Table Associations
- Authentication
- Authorization
- Validation

We learned Rails before learning JavaScript so this app doesn't contain any JavaScript.
